A brief introduction to static analysis tools and techniques for Android application security research.

## Why Static Analysis?

Static analysis allows us to examine Android applications without executing them, enabling:

- Large-scale analysis of app stores
- Detection of security vulnerabilities
- Compliance verification

## Key Tools

### FlowDroid

FlowDroid is a precise taint analysis tool for Android applications. It handles Android's lifecycle and callback mechanisms.

### SootUp

SootUp is the next-generation version of Soot, providing improved performance and a cleaner API for static analysis.

## Getting Started

Start with the official documentation and sample projects to understand the basics before tackling research problems.
