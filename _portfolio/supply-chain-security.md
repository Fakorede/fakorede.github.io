# Exploring malicious package detection for Android/JVM ecosystems and Flutter/pub.dev

## Overview

Software supply chain attacks have become increasingly prevalent. My research explores underexplored areas in malicious package detection:

<!-- - **Android/JVM Ecosystems**: Detecting malicious libraries in Maven Central and other repositories
- **Flutter/pub.dev**: Security analysis of Dart/Flutter packages
- **Dependency Analysis**: Understanding transitive dependency risks -->

## Research Directions

This is an emerging area with strong publication potential, as these ecosystems receive less security research attention compared to npm or PyPI.

## Techniques

- Static analysis for detecting suspicious code patterns
- Behavioral analysis of package functionality
- Dependency graph analysis for propagation risks
