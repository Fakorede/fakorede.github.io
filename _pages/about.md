I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [Louisiana State University](https://www.lsu.edu/), working as a Graduate Research Assistant under [Dr. Umar Farooq](https://csc.lsu.edu/~ufarooq/). My research lies at the intersection of **program analysis**, **formal methods**, and **mobile security** , with a particular focus on developing static analysis techniques for mobile platforms.
My current work investigates compliance and security violations in Android Auto applications, where I apply callback-aware static analysis to ensure apps meet safety requirements. I am also exploring **software supply chain security**, particularly in Android/JVM ecosystems, where malicious package detection remains an underexplored area.
Ultimately, I aim to build automated tools that make mobile software ecosystems safer and more reliable, helping detect and prevent security and usability issues before they reach users.


<!-- My broader goal is to bridge the gap between formal verification techniques and practical security analysis, making these methods more accessible and scalable for real-world software systems. -->


<!-- I have hands-on experience with distributed systems including Apache Spark and Hadoop, and enjoy working on open-source software in my spare time. -->

## Research Interests

- **Static Analysis**: Developing techniques for analyzing Android applications
- **Android Security**: Investigating compliance violations and security vulnerabilities in mobile applications
